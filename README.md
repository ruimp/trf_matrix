# Transfer Matrix Algorithm for Stratified Media

## Introduction

We aim to simulate light propagation through stratified media. We apply the algorithm to the study of reflectance coefficient of light passing through layered polymer chunks mediated by graphene oxide layers.

## Method

### Setting up the system

We satisfy the boundary conditions at each layer using a transfer matrix method. We build the transfer matrix for the system by composing layers of graphene with
